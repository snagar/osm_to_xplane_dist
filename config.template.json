  // commented out or Empty value, means process all files
  // 5: "osm_to_wavefront" : This is the first step were we create the base mesh, if we find a "{file}_osm_obj8.obj" present, we will skip the obj creation, since the file was already processed to obj8
  // 10: "pre-blender": Test the "{file}_osm_obj8.obj" existence, before calling blender. Meaning, we want to create the "wavefront" obj file, maybe for tests/debug purposes.
  // In 99% of cases, you should use the first option: 5, since it will immediatelly figure out the "final" file and will skip most of the work for it.
